# terraform-eks
A sample repository to create EKS on AWS using Terraform.

### Install AWS CLI 

As the first step, you need to install AWS CLI as we will use the AWS CLI (`aws configure`) command to connect Terraform with AWS in the next steps.

Follow the below link to Install AWS CLI.
```
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
```

### Install Terraform

Next, Install Terraform using the below link.

```

### Initialize Terraform

Clone the repository and Run `terraform init`. This will intialize the terraform environment for you and download the modules, providers and other configuration required.

### Optionally review the terraform configuration

Run `terraform plan` to see the configuration it creates when executed.

### Finally, Apply terraform configuation to create EKS cluster with VPC 

`terraform apply`
